# Transmission Chain Simulator

The Transmission Chain Simulator is a Python project designed to simulate a transmission chain, focusing on verifying conditions related to emission and reception filters. This project is intended for educational purposes or for anyone interested in understanding and experimenting with communication systems.

## Features

- Simulate a transmission chain with emission and reception filters.
- Validate conditions and parameters related to signal transmission.
- Easily configurable settings for experimentation and analysis.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for experimentation and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your machine.
